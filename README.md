# Digital-Physics-Wallpapers

Each folder contains the script for generating a mobile phone or desktop wallpaper. Also included in the folder is the direct or indirect output of the drawing logic when exported. This is accomplished in .pde files with save("filename.png") or saveFrame("Export/filename_########.png"). 

The wallpapers have a basis in mathematics and physics for their design logic. Over time I will add ReadMe files to each folder with a brief description of the principles being used(parametric equations, modulus operators, Pappus chains, etc.)

These wallpapers are designed within Processing's flexible software sketchbook:
